### A Wordpress e-commerce plugin

## 	Philosophy
	This plugin was designed as a *single-use specified* shopping cart plugin. It is intended to be a 
	*pseudo-customizable multi-use* e-commerce plugin. The code will be updated over time with the goal
	of being a re-usable library of classes, but still requiring use-specific product definitions and
	front end pages. In this, the programmer has a great structure with which to build customized 
	e-commerce solutions, while still maintaining a site-unique feel. Processing interface code will
	added as site builds require them.

## 	Features
*	manage products: adding, editing
*	manage categories: adding, editing, deleting
*	manage orders: view
*	shopping cart front end: 1-teir category listing, product pages
*	checkout front end: checkout functionality coupled with selected processing

## 	Supported Processing
*	Amazon FPS / AWS
